We will examine the scenario of optimally controlling your home's temperature when you are gone for a certain period of time. Say you keep the temperature of your home, $x(t)$, at a fixed temperature $I$ when you are around. Assume that you are going to be leaving for a winter vacation, and you want the home to be the same temperature when you return, but you don't care about the temperature when you are gone. We will examine the problem of controlling the home's heating system so you use the least amount of energy, but still achieve your desired temperature when you return.
