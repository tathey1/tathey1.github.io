Have you ever taken a picture of the face of someone you love, or of some text for future reference? If you used an [iPhone 14](https://www.apple.com/iphone-14/specs/), then the picture you captured is a data point in a space with millions of dimensions. However, it is well known that [faces](https://doi.org/10.1109/tpami.2007.1033) and [text](https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x) live in much lower dimensional spaces! In many ways, images are extremely inefficient representations of information, but they are here to stay (after all, we have a whole lobe of our brain basically dedicated to processing visuals). I am interested in designing methods and implementing open software to extract information from images to answer biological questions about the brain.

Very much the product of the [BRAIN Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/), I spent my PhD working under Professors [Michael Miller](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/michael-i-miller/) and [Joshua Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/) to build algorithms for neuron segmentation and tracing, and numerical methods for transforming and analyzing digitial neuron traces at the micron scale. I also deeply enjoyed both mentoring and teaching in various capacities at Johns Hopkins, and hope to pursue an academic career. Currently, I am a MIT - Novo Nordisk Artificial Intelligence Postdoctoral fellow and I hope to contribute active learning algorithms to accelerate the reconstruction of the mouse connectome from electron microscopy images.
